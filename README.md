# Handyman-App-Final-Prototype
For this project, I had to learn Android Studio and Kotlin from the very basics since this was going to be an Android Mobile Application. 
This is just a prototype of the application and a lot of the functionality is hard-coded, however, I do plan to make this app fully functional in the upcoming months using Java.
